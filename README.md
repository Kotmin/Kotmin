# 👨🏻‍🍳 Kotmin

**`Code Chef (Developer/Creator/Scientist)`**

### Hi there 👋


Greetings! I'm Paweł, a Python Developer passionate about development and AI implementations. I specialize in crafting web applications using Python frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Django. While I'm versatile, my heart lies in backend development. I usually go for PostgresSQL in terms of database implementation, but, of course, only if it aligns with the project's needs. By the way, I teach and share knowledge both in person and through my YouTube channel "[Groovy Tech Cat][youtube]". I excel at finding software bugs and paying meticulous attention to details.
