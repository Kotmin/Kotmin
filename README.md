# Kotmin

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Greetings! I'm PaweÅ‚, a Python Developer passionate about development and AI implementations. I specialize in crafting web applications using Python frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Django. While I'm versatile, my heart lies in backend development. I usually go for PostgresSQL in terms of database implementation, but, of course, only if it aligns with the project's needs. I have a knack for spotting software bugs.
